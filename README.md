# rugbypredictor
This project predicts the outcome of rugby matches based on historical match data, team performance and various other features. The model uses machine learning techniques to classify match outcomes.

## Features

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: A thorough analysis of historical match data to discover trends and patterns.
**Feature Engineering**: Creation of additional features to improve model accuracy (e.g., home/away advantage, win/loss streaks).
**Machine Learning Model**: A classification model trained to predict match outcomes (win/loss) using historical data.
**Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and feature importance analysis.
**Interactive Dashboard**: An optional future feature to allow users to input match data and predict outcomes.
